/// This trait forms the core of the `Opcode` representation. It provides the
/// basic set of operations that are required of all opcodes, and is implemented
/// by each of the concrete opcodes.
///
/// # Object Safety and Enum Completeness
///
/// This trait must remain
/// [object safe](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/traits.html#object-safety)
/// as the implementors of the trait will be used in dynamic dispatch.
///
/// However, the intention is also to be able to wrap subsets of the `Opcode`s
/// into enums during the analysis phase.
///
/// # Self Bounds
///
/// The bounds on `Self` are required by these traits for the following reasons:
///
/// - [`Any`] allows downcasting to concrete implementations of `Opcode` if
///   needed.
/// - [`Debug`] to provide representations to aid in debugging. It is
///   recommended to use the derive feature for this.
/// - [`Downcast`] for easy conversions _to_ [`Any`] for downcasting.
///
/// In addition, it is recommended but not enforced that implementors of this
/// trait also implement [`Copy`], [`Clone`], [`Eq`] and [`PartialEq`].
///
/// # Terminology
///
/// When referring to stack slots, we treat index 1 as being the top of the
/// stack.
